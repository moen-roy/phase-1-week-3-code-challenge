      "content": "The president of Kenya, hon William Ruto, orders the media to stop live broadcasting of the ongoing protests in 25 June 2025. This might seem as a small matter but its actually very serious. This action left many questions among the citizens of why this was essential but many did get their answers. This is because during the none media broadcast,most of the Gen Z protesters were mercilessly killed by snipers positioned and given direct order by the president to kill as many as possible. This protests were to commemorate the fallen soldiers from last years 'Reject finance bill' protests but now it has led to more life loss.The war is still continuing, stay tuned for more update. ",
